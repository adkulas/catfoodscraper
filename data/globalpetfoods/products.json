    "description": "Our amazingFlora4 Ground Sprouted Seed mixessimplify the chore of effectively supplementing the live probiotics, plant enzymes, phytonutrients and whole food vitamins & minerals that are lacking in an all-meat diet.Flora4contains only 100% raw organic sprouted seeds, making any raw diet easy and consistent. OurFlora4 Originalformula is a blend of organic sprouted barley seed, flaxseed, and lentils, ground into a fine powder and packaged in daily servings. Our newFlora4 Greens Pluscontains organic sprouted broccoli seed, pumpkin, peas, sunflower and chia. Mix formulas to give your pet the nutrition of 10 different seeds, or alternate.You canuseFlora4whenever your pet needs supplemental enzymes and probioticsfora wide range of issues:During and after treatment with antibioticsre-seed the gutTocorrect intermittent diarrhea, constipation, gasand soft stoolsTo aid digestionwhen transitioning from one diet to anotherfor the first time.Forimmune support(sprouted Broccoli is great for this!)Relieveitchy skin, dry coat, yeasty earsGet up cat hairballsYou can addFlora4to every mealto supply all your animal’s non-meat nutritional requirements. Or if you already mix foods like tripe, green leafy & root vegetables into your animal’s raw diet, try usingFlora4every couple of days to “fill in the gaps”. That way, you can be sure that you’re not missing any essential vitamins & minerals with your homemade recipes.Your raw-fed cat can also benefitfrom the intense nutrition inFlora4. Be sure to add healthy sources of taurine such as organ meat – pork liver and duck liver are two excellent examples.Flora4 is extremely versatile.It can be sprinkled into raw, home-cooked or commercial kibble to boost nutrition and complete the diet or raise the nutrition. If your main pet food contains vitamin/mineral additives, then you should consider supplementing the diet with doses ofFlora4every day or two, to make sure your pet is getting really bio-available nutrients from food, not just synthetics. Our testing has shown that dogs and cats love the mix of flavors from meat + our sprouted seed blend.Flora4gives Raw feeders the convenient whole food supplement they’ve been waiting for — no need to use bottled synthetic products again!Flora4 contains guaranteed levels of live probiotics(18 billion cfu/kg) and enzymes (1 million U/kg); effective doses of 26 essential vitamins & minerals; and high levels of Omega 6 & 3 fatty acids – all from raw food – that combine to provide a variety of health benefits for dogs and cats.Our Flora4 Sprouted Seed Mix delivers total nutrition that ONLY COMES FROM WHOLE PLANT FOOD.  Sprouting unlocks and activates massive amounts of vitamins, minerals, probiotics and enzymes stored in nature’s original building blocks. Once sprouted, seeds become highly digestible sources of intense nutrition which is easily absorbed by the body. This is far more effective than relying on synthetic vitamins & minerals which do not work in harmony with natural body metabolism.When your dog or cat gets its nutrients from actual food, it also absorbs thousands of micro-nutrients that surround each vitamin or probiotic, working synergistically with the body to help it absorb and use the vitamins. These micro-nutrients are only available within the natural structure of a whole food and are left behind when a synthetic vitamin is chemically extracted. When added to conventional pet food,Flora4can provide your pet the missing nutrition just as nature intended.Flora4perfectly supplements raw and home cooked diets with all the necessary vitamins, minerals, live probiotics and enzymes which may be insufficient in a pure meat diet. OrFlora4can be added to any kibble to supply highly bio-available, food-based nutrients for vibrant health.The plant-based enzymes in Flora4are biologically active in a broad pH range, which means they support your pet’s healthy gut flora in a larger portion of its digestive tract, where pH levels can vary considerably.Flora4 also adds soluble fiberto your dog’s diet, keeping intestines functioning smoothly and also helping keep your dog feeling full longer. Perfect for dogs eating a raw diet without much volume.Finally, as a probiotic supplement,Flora4is uniquely effective. Most commercial probiotics are created by isolating individual strains of microorganisms, and artificially stimulating their reproduction in a laboratory environment. In the final product, the selected probiotics have been separated from the intrinsic supporting microbes that were present in the original natural state and critical to the survival of the selected strain. In isolation, the absorption and use of the probiotic by the body will be greatly reduced.In contrast, when a native probioticfound in a raw food likeFlora4is ingested while still in its natural host environment, it remains supported by the full range of original microorganisms that allow it to function. It will stay healthy, viable and be much more bio-available for absorption within the animal’s intestine. Now that’s something to toot about!Try Flora4 as a handy stool correctorfor those times when your pet gets a bout of diarrhea. The high quality fiber from the sprouted seeds helps form a good stool, while the massive doses of natural probiotics and enzymes will help to correct the digestion issues in a short period of time. Usually, a couple of days’ treatment with each meal is all you need.Our customers continue to tell us about their experiences withFlora4– helping to manage a variety of issues from yeast problems to skin & coat conditions to allergy symptoms. The concentrated, bio-available nutrients, fatty acids, antioxidants, probiotics and enzymes can giveFlora4an important role in supporting your pet’s immune system and keeping him healthy.",
